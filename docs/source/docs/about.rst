About
=========

We're the Programming Subteam of `FRC Team 687 <https://687camsrobotics.wixsite.com/mysite>`_. This website 
aims to serve as a repository for team software knowledge and provide documentation for team libraries.

All of our code (including the source for this site!) is available on our `Github <github.com/nerdherd>`_.

Subteam Goals 
-------------------------------
- Every member of the subteam contributes to the software of the current year’s robot or is on track to in future years
- Members feel like they’re contributing and feel like they are a part of the team
- Members of the subteam learn technical skills which would assist them if they were to pursue a career/education in a computer science-related field
- Document our subteam’s work each year
- Keep our workspaces (cabinets, laptop filesystems, etc.) clean and organized
- Improve the overall software knowledge base of the programming subteam and maintain the current software knowledge base
